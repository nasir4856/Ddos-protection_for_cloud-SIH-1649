A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. 
# Introduction
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks leverage multiple compromised devices or networks, often spread across different geographical locations, to send a large volume of requests or data to the target system.

How it Works: DDoS attacks are usually carried out through botnets, which are networks of hijacked devices that attackers control remotely. Each compromised device, or bot, continuously sends requests to the target, overwhelming it.
